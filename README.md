# Powerbook Duo Dummy Battery

This model was created because my battery for my Powerbook Duo was leaking, so I did not want the battery in the laptop, but I had no intention of rebuilding the battery, so I modelled a dummy battery to go into the slot to add stability to the top case when I'm using the laptop.

This model could be a good starting point for someone that actually wanted to make it into a Powerbook Duo battery case to build a new battery, so here is the model open sourced for anyone that might find it useful.
